    <h1>Cheesecake</h1>
    <img src="../fot/cheesecake.jpg" alt="amazing looking cheesecake"
    <p>For a recipe with so few ingredients (cream cheese, eggs, sugar, sour cream, vanilla & salt), it took a lot longer than you might think to develop the perfect version. I’ve shared a few cheesecake variations in the past, including my No-Bake Cheesecake, but getting a perfected classic version took lots of testing. Finally, here we are.</p>
    <h2> Ingredients</h2>
    <h1>Graham Cracker Crust</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups graham cracker crumbs</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon brown sugar (can substitute white)</li>
        <li>7 Tablespoons butter melted</li>
    </ul>
    <h1> Cheesecake</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>32 oz cream cheese² softened to room temperature</li>
        <li>1 cup sugar (200g)</li>
        <li>⅔ cups sour cream (160g)</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li> 4 large eggs</li>

    </ul>

    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 325F (160C).</li>
        <li>Prepare Graham Cracker crust first by combining graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and brown sugar, and stirring well. Add melted butter and use a fork to combine ingredients well.</li>
        <li>Pour crumbs into a 9” Springform pan and press firmly into the bottom and up the sides of your pan. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer or in a large bowl (using a hand mixer) add cream cheese and stir until smooth and creamy (don’t over-beat or you’ll incorporate too much air).</li>
        <li>Add sugar and stir again until creamy.</li>
        <li>Add sour cream, vanilla extract, and salt, and stir until well-combined. If using a stand mixer, make sure you pause periodically to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl with a spatula so that all ingredients are evenly incorporated.</li>
        <li>Transfer to the center rack of your oven and bake on 325F (160C) for about 75 minutes. Edges will likely have slightly puffed and may have just begun to turn a light golden brown and the center should spring back to the touch but will still be Jello-jiggly. Don't over-bake or the texture will suffer, which means we all suffer.</li>
