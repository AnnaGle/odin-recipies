    <h1>Brownie</h1>
    <img src="../recipes/brownie.html" alt="slices of fresh baked brownie"
    <p>Back to Michelle’s recipe for brownies! In order for it to turn out like (aka better than) the boxed mix, Michelle uses granulated sugar, all-purpose flour, salt, and chocolate chips.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup of Powdered sugar</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon of unsweetened cocoa powder </li>
        <li>1 cup of Oil</li>
    </ol>
    <h1> Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>First, mix together the dry and wet ingredients in two separate bowls. Combine the sugar, flour, powdered sugar, cocoa powder, chocolate chips, and salt in a medium bowl. Then, whisk together the eggs, olive oil, and water in a large one.</li>
        <li>Next, combine the wet and dry ingredients. Sprinkle the dry mixture over the wet one, and fold until just combined. The batter will be thick!</li>
        <li>Then, pour the batter into an 8 per 8 inch baking pan lined with parchment paper. Use a rubber spatula to spread it to all four sides of the pan and to smooth the top. The mixture will be very thick – that’s ok.</li>
        <li>Finally, bake! Transfer the pan to a 325-degree oven and bake for 40 to 45 minutes, until a toothpick inserted comes out with a few crumbs attached. Allow the brownies to cool completely before slicing and serving. Enjoy!</li>
